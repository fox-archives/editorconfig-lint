# editorconfig-lint

A hacked and buggy up "linter" that I use this to lint all my `.editorconfig` files to ensure they have the proper formatting and settings. This includes

- Correct spacing (brackets, equals sign, newlines)
- Certain settings have been set

The linting rules are really opinionated

## Installation

```sh
pnpm i -g editorconfig-lint
```
